# NanoLink System

A comprehensive integrated system combining blockchain, AI, and advanced communication technologies.

## Overview

NanoLink represents an advanced integration of blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and communication technologies to deliver a cohesive, scalable, and secure communication infrastructure. The system addresses pressing limitations in bandwidth, latency, interoperability, and security.

## Core Components

1. Translators and Universal Protocol Layer
2. Layer-2 Blockchain Infrastructure
3. Semantic Communication Engine
4. Federated AI Training and Validation
5. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)
6. Governance and Security Framework
7. Edge Node Infrastructure

## Detailed Documentation

### 1. Translators and Universal Protocol Layer

The protocol layer functions as a middleware, translating data from disparate communication standards into a unified NanoLink semantic structure. This ensures seamless interoperability across devices, from IoT sensors to molecular transceivers.

#### Operation:
- Supports key protocols like MQTT (lightweight IoT messaging), CoAP (resource-constrained devices), and HTTP/3 (high-efficiency networks)
- Translates incoming data streams into a standardized format
- Removes redundant metadata while preserving semantic intent
